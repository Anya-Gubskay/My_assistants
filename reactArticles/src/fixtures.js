    "title":"Unknown Leonardo da Vinci",
              "text": "Five hundred years before modern cooking books, The Kitchen Notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci envisioned a culinary world as studio and laboratory, where food was to be prepared efficiently, beautifully, and ingeniously. Unfortunately, Italian food of the late fifteenth century had less to do with the luxurious feats of Ancient Rome and more to do with the rustic tastes of the Goths, whose dishes included meats and birds for those who could afford it, and an endless parade of porridge and gruel for those who could not. Leonardo was horrified by much of the food that was served to him, both at court and at home, and he included in his notebooks a running list of dishes that he hated, but that his own servant insisted on serving him: jellied goat, hemp bread,  inedible turnips, and eel balls—which he notes, “this dish if eaten often can cause madness.”",

        "text": "Movcha (Moses) Chagall was, as he put it, “born dead” on July 7, 1887, in the Belorussian town of Vitebsk, near the Polish border. His distraught family pricked the limp body of their firstborn with needles to try to stimulate a response. With that rude introduction to life, it’s no wonder that Marc stuttered as a boy and was subject to fainting. “I was scared of growing up. Even in my twenties I preferred dreaming about love and painting it in my pictures,” he said.”",

Nobody knew her name at the time, or the name of the artist who had made the portrait. The catalog listed the work—a colored chalk-and-ink drawing on vellum—as early 19th century and German, with borrowed Renaissance styling. A New York dealer, Kate Ganz, purchased the picture for $21,850.”",
